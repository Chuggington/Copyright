 <h1> Copyright, is it good or bad?</h1>
  <p> Copyright is a great thing, and it useful for many people. </p>
  <p> It protects aspiring creators from having their work stolen from them and gain the ability to make money off their own products. </p>
  <p> Without this protection they could have their work taken and others would take this product and get their own money for it.</p>
  <p> I think that Copyright should always be a thing and protection should be always over creators. </p>
